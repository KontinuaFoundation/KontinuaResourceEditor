# Web App

To use, open `index.html` in the web browser of your choice.

## Creating new JSONs

Simply move through the fields, skipping the upload field at the beginning. It is not needed for a fresh file. If you have empty fields, don't worry. The code will automatically ignore them.

## Editing JSONs

Drag and drop or click to upload the JSON you want to edit at the first step. If it is not a valid format, it will be rejected. The fields should auto-populate and you should be good to edit from there.

## Output

Once you download the JSON, it will be in your downloads folder as `digital_resources.json`. Move it from there to the language folder of the chapter it was made for.

If the output is saved as `digital_resources (1).json` or anything similar, be sure to remove the dupliacte prevention after you move it. The chapters folders should only have `digital_resources.json`
